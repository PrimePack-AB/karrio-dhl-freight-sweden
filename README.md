# karrio.dhl_freight_sweden

This package is a DHL Freight Sweden extension of the [karrio](https://pypi.org/project/karrio) multi carrier shipping SDK.

It targets the DHL Freight Sweden API Farm and authenticates with a single `client-key` header (no token exchange).
It covers shipment booking with a printed label and a URL-only tracking link surfaced through the shipment `meta`.

## Requirements

`Python 3.11+`

## Installation

```bash
pip install karrio.dhl_freight_sweden
```

## Usage

```python
import karrio.sdk as karrio
from karrio.mappers.dhl_freight_sweden.settings import Settings


# Initialize a carrier gateway
dhl_freight_sweden = karrio.gateway["dhl_freight_sweden"].create(
    Settings(
        client_key="...",       # DHL Freight Sweden API Farm client key (sent as the client-key header)
        account_number="...",    # freight-payer party id
        test_mode=True,          # sandbox (test-api.freight-logistics.dhl.com) vs production
    )
)
```

## Capabilities

| Capability | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Shipping | Book then print by id in one `shipment/create` call. |
| Rating | Static rate sheet (universal rating mixin); no carrier call. |
| Product matches | Connector-local lookup (`gateway.proxy.find_product_matches`). |
| Service points | Connector-local lookup (`gateway.proxy.find_service_points`). |

## PUDO workflow lookups

The two lookups are connector-local: karrio has no unified service-points or
product-match interface, so the methods are called directly on the proxy and
register no connection capability.

```python
from karrio.providers.dhl_freight_sweden import (
    product_matches,
    service_points,
)

# 1. Eligible products for an address pair (optional piece criteria).
request = product_matches.product_matches_request(
    {
        "shipper": {"postal_code": "11120", "country_code": "SE"},
        "recipient": {"postal_code": "00-251", "country_code": "PL"},
        "parcels": [{"weight": 2.5, "length": 40, "width": 30, "height": 15}],
    },
    gateway.settings,
)
products, messages = product_matches.parse_product_matches_response(
    gateway.proxy.find_product_matches(request), gateway.settings
)

# 2. Nearest service points (address required; filters optional). Both
#    identifiers are returned: prefer `service_point_id` — in some countries
#    `id` is a constant point-type code rather than a unique identifier.
request = service_points.service_points_request(
    {
        "address": {
            "street": "Nowogrodzka 31",
            "city": "Warszawa",
            "postal_code": "00-251",
            "country_code": "PL",
        },
        "max_items": 5,
    },
    gateway.settings,
)
points, messages = service_points.parse_service_points_response(
    gateway.proxy.find_service_points(request), gateway.settings
)

# 3. Book with the chosen point: feed `service_point_id` (or `id`), `name`
#    and the address into the five service-point options — the shipment
#    create flow emits the complete AccessPoint party. A `locker` point
#    books with `service_point_type` "ParcelStation"; every other location
#    type books as "ParcelShop" (the default).
```

Service-point ids, names, and addresses must come from the locator: DHL does
not registry-validate them at booking, so invented values misroute rather
than fail. The locator exposes no opening hours (Servicepoint API 2.10.0).
